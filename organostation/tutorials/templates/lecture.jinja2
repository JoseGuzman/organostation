{#
This is the main layout for the lectures. It uses the
nav and footer menues from the layout.jijna2. Then,
it loads the CSS and loads the left menu from menusidebar.jinja2

The routes must provide a variable 'mytarget' with the location
of the index.html located in every subfolder (e.g., day0/index.html)
#}
{% extends "menusidebar.jinja2" %} {# also includes layout.jinja2 #}

{% block tutorial_content %}
