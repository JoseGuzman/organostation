<h1><strong>Sample preparation</strong></h1>

<p>This guide is the most important part of the tutorials, and it will guide you through the preparation of the organoid
	for the recording procedure. Neural tissue has special properties that make it sensitive to changes in
	mechano-chemical conditions. Thus, special care is required when handling the preparation.</p>

	<h1>1. Tissue immobilization</h1>

	<p>One of the most important elements in an electrical recording is mechanical stability. We will use 4% (wt/vol)
		low-melt agarose (<a
			href="https://www.biozym.com/media/pdf/58/26/76/85008X_Datenblatt-Biozym-Sieve-GeneticPure_vers-0-4.pdf"
			target="_blank">Biozym, Cat. No. 850080</a>) in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) to immobilize the organoid
		within the recording chamber. Also, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) will be delivered at a rate of 2-3
		mL/min while keeping both solution and chamber near physiological temperature (30-35 &deg;C ). When keeping
		mechanical stability, the composition of the fluid, and the temperature of the tissue, we can guarantee
		recordings are performed under neurophysiological conditions.</p>

	<h2>1.1 Preparation table</h2>

	<p>We recommend having the recording station close to the culture room to avoid mechanical stress on the organoids.
		Before starting the procedure, have a bottle (e.g., 500 mL) of ACSF gassed with carbogen for at least 20 minutes
		to equilibrate the pH solution (~ 7.25-7.35) at room temperature.</p>

	<p>Once taken from the incubator, cerebral organoids are to keep at near-physiological temperature (30-35 &deg;C )
		in ACSF for ten minutes (e.g., in a 35-mm petri dish). While keeping the organoids in ACSF, it is recommended to
		melt the 4% low-melt agarose (using a thermal block, or in a thermal cycler). At the same time, we can fill a 10
		x 10 mL plastic container with ice, and cover it with a paper blanket. We will allocate the recording chamber on
		top of the blanket. In this way, the chamber is very cold, but not frozen. On both sides of the chamber, we will
		have preparation tools (like pipettes of different sizes, filter paper, etc. see below).</p>

	<p>The preparation table must be visible&nbsp;under a bench-top magnifier or low-power microscope, as depicted
		below.</p>

	<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">

				<td style="width:750px"><img alt="sample"

		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>Here is a summary of the tools to have on the preparation table:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>ACSF bubbled in Carbogen for 20 minutes at room temperature.</li>
		<li>Organoids in ACSF at near physiological temperature (30-35 &deg;C ) in a 35 mm petri dish</li>
		<li>1.5 mL Eppendorf containing 4% agar melted in a thermal block at around 50 &deg;C&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A plastic cube (~ 10 x 10 cm) filled with ice</li>
		<li>Preparation tools:
			<ul>
				<li>1) 1mL and 200 microL eppendorf pipettes</li>
				<li>2) 5 mL syringe</li>
				<li>3) Plastic Pasteur Pipette</li>
				<li>5) Dissecting needle</li>
				<li>4) Filter paper (e.g., Watmann) or Kim-wipe / absorbent swab</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>1.2 Embedding the organoid</h2>

	<p>Now that we have the organoid on the dish, we will use the plastic Pasteur pipette (or an Eppendorf pipette tip)
		and cut it to obtain a ~ 5 mm diameter tip or larger. It allows us to get the organoid with some ACSF without
		touching the tissue. We use it to move from the petri dish to the recording chamber on the preparation table.
		Note that the organoid will contain a few microliters (maybe up to 1 mL) of ACSF in the recording chamber. We
		will eliminate those with a 1 mL Eppendorf pipette. After that, use the filter paper (or Kim-wipe / absorbent
		swab) carefully, to remove the excess liquid around the border of the organoid. It is essential to dry the
		border to allow the agar to surround the tissue and fix it together with the chamber. After it, we will add ~200
		microliters of 4% melted agarose in the surroundings of the organoid, that in contact with the frozen chamber,
		will solidify immediately. This is when we add ~ 2 mL of ACSF at room temperature with the plastic Pasteur
		pipette. Once immersed in ACSF, the organoid on the recording chamber must be transported to the organostation,
		and start the perfusion of warm (~ 35&nbsp;&deg;C) ACSF with the peristaltic pump.</p>

	<p>Here is the whole process summarized.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Move the organoid for the 35 mm petri dish to the recording chamber.</li>
		<li>Remove the excess ACSF with an Eppendorf pipette, and dry out the borders of the organoid with filter paper.
		</li>
		<li>Add immediately ~ 200 uL of melted 4% agar around the borders of the organoid.</li>
		<li>Cover the organoid with warm ACSF (about 2 mL).</li>
		<li>Move the chamber carefully&nbsp;to the organostation&nbsp;and start the perfusion of warm (~ 35&nbsp;&deg;C)
			ACSF</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The most critical step is drying out the border of the organoids. Neural tissue will immediately die and suffer
		from anoxia if not in the presence of ACSF. Therefore, the organoid must be kept in ACSF as long as possible.

	<h1>2. Electrode penetration</h1>

	<p>Once the chamber is in the organostation, look carefully if the organoid remains embedded in the agar block. If
		yes, it is time to take the probes and insert them into the adaptor for the micromanipulators. For that, you
		need to move the manipulators at a fast speed outside of the recording chamber. Once there, inset the probes on
		the manipulators, and do not forget to allocate the reference electrode inside the bath (see figure).</p>

	<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td style="width:750px"><img alt="grounding"
						src="{{ url_for('tutorials_bp.static', filename='img/grounding.jpg')}}" style="width:750px" />
				</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>After setting the grounding electrode, move the manipulators fast until you see them under the microscope. At the
		same time, monitor the noise of the recordings on your computer. Noise is very large if the electrodes are
		outside ACSF. Once the electrodes are on top of the organoid, select a slower speed and move downwards. The
		moment you touch the surface of the organoid, you will see that the noise of the electrodes increases slightly.
		This is when you set the counter to zero in the manipulator pad, and move the probe using the wheel very slowly
		(~ 10 um per cycle). Monitor that you insert the probes&nbsp; ~ 200 - 300 micrometers deep in the organoid,
		because that&#39;s where active neurons migrate during the development of organoids. Deeper insertions may
		contain stem cells and neural progenitors, or reach necrotic areas that do not have active electrical
		properties.</p>

	<h2>2.1 Documenting recordings</h2>

	<p>Once the desired location is reached, wait for ~10-25 minutes to let the tissue recover. You can monitor the
		oscilloscope in the presence of extracellular spikes appearing spontaneously in closed electrode locations. Note
		that small movements may activate close-by neurons, and electrical artifacts (e.g., switches, steppers, etc.)
		may contribute to electrical signals sampled by electrodes but are not from neurons.</p>

	<p>Once you can reproduce the presence of extracellular spiking activity around a group of electrodes, you can start
		the recording and monitor the location - we recommend recording at least 10 minutes-. The binary files are
		updating in your computer, and we advise to start entering all recordings details in a small dataset, like the
		one in this example:</p>

	<p><img alt="stable" src="{{ url_for('tutorials_bp.static', filename = 'img/stable.jpg') }}" style="width:750px" />
	</p>
</section>

<section id="cleaning">
	<p>Once the acquisition is made, and the binary file is stored, you must operate carefully to remove the probes from
		the manipulator. During this time, the tissue can remain at physiological temperature and with the proper
		recirculation in the chamber. It helps if you require to perform a new recording on a different day and recover
		after the brief immersion of the probes. To remove the probes, move the manipulator to the furthest possible
		position, and once there, far away from the tissue, remove the PCB that contains the probe.</p>

	<h1>3. Cleaning protocol</h1>

	<p>Ideally,&nbsp;you would like to start and end cleaning the experiment with a cleaning procedure to eliminate
		contamination from your probes. You can clean the probes by immersing them in a 1% (w/v) <a
			href="https://www.coleparmer.com/i/alconox-tergazyme-1304-1-enzyme-active-powered-detergent-4-lb-box/1777705"
			rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tergazyme</a> in dH2O solution at ~50 degrees for 20 minutes.
		After that, you can remove debris with a small brush under visual inspection (e.g., bench-top magnifier) that
		contains abundant drops of bi-distilled water.&nbsp;</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Immersion in 1% (w/v) tergazyme at ~ 50&nbsp;&deg;C for approximately 20 minutes.</li>
		<li>Rinse abundantly with&nbsp;bi-distilled water at ~ 50&nbsp;&deg;C&nbsp; (brush if necessary)</li>
	</ol>


	<h2>3.1 Probe cleaning and storage</h2>

	<p>To clean the probe before storage, you will need a cleaning station (see the image below) that contains
		a&nbsp;moveable stand to soak the probe shank(s) in a heated magnetic stirrer bath. Insert the probes first in
		1%&nbsp;<a
			href="https://www.coleparmer.com/i/alconox-tergazyme-1304-1-enzyme-active-powered-detergent-4-lb-box/1777705"
			rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tergazyme</a> at ~50 degrees for approximately 20 minutes (*), and
		clean them as described in the cleaning protocol. This time, we add a last step that includes treatment in
		iso-propanol before storage in&nbsp;a Falcon Tube containing 30 mL of distilled H2O.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Immersion in 1% (w/v) tergazyme at ~ 50&nbsp;&deg;C for approximately 20 minutes.</li>
		<li>Rinse abundantly with&nbsp;bi-distilled water at ~ 50&nbsp;&deg;C&nbsp; (brush if necessary).</li>
		<li>Brush visually with iso-propanol at room temperature.</li>
		<li>Storage of probes in Falcon Tube in distilled water.&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Alternatively,you can use Trypsin 10X (Cat. No, 59427C from Sigma) diluted 1:10 in distilled water to soak the
		probe shanks for a few hours at 35 degrees Celsius.</p>
